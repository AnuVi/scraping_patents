# Tools

- Excel/PowerQuery

# Steps
## Scraping data

1. Search term was "*". Day later there were 1165/1164 results.
   - in Excel there were 1163 rows?
3. The most time consuming was:
   - Learning how to do pagination part - sure, I do not remember it next time.
   - Getting one company's data into one row.

   - Started to cleaning data in Excel and then realized there were <em>company/director<em> vs <em>attrorney/company confusion<em>. So, it was much easier to conifigure scraping part than do it in Excel.
