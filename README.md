# Steps
## Scraping data

1. Search term was "*". Day later there were 1165/1164 results.
   - in excel there were 1163 rows?
3. The most time consuming was:
   - Learning how to do pagination part - sure, I do not remember it next time.
   - Getting one company's data into one row.

   - Figuring out that actually quite a few companies had website and it wasn't scraping mistake.

1. ID/webscraper-order
   Duplicated the column webscraper-order, extracted '1739479965-'and changed type to numbers. Id column helps to handle changing/updating in the future.
